## Root Module Structure

[Standard Module Structure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure)

```
  ________ PROJECT_ROOT ________
 |                              |
 ├── main.tf         - root module
 ├── variables.tf    - store the structure of input variables of the module
 ├── terraform.tfvars - store the variables of the module
 ├── outputs.tf      - store the output of the module
 ├── providers.tf    - store the required providers of the module
 ├── README.md
 └── LICENSE
```

💡 you can run the `tree` command to see the structure of the module

## TF Variables in TF Cloud

We can set two kinds of variables:

- Terraform Variables - those that live in the local terraform.tfvars file
- Environment Variables - those that live in workspace environment (e.g. AWS credentials)

Learn about TF variables precedence in TF cloud [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables#precedence).

## Migrating from TF Cloud to TF CLI

Comment out the `cloud` block, then delete the tf lock file and the `.terraform` directory. Lastly, run `terraform init` to initialize the module. Also make sure to run `terraform destroy` before finishing a session in GitPod.

## Loading TF Variables and the TFVars file

You can store variables inside a `.tfvars` file and then pass it to the module using the `-var-file` flag. You can also use the `-var` flag to pass variables to the module. The `terraform.tfvars` file is automatically loaded by Terraform.

```bash
user_uuid = "73abc949-c183-4c61-bda6-a724952ec87d"
```

Since `terraform.tfvars` won't be commited to GH, we can copy the `terraform.tfvars.example` and create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the same content on worskpace creation.

You can also use `auto.tfvars` to automatically load variables. This file is loaded first, then `terraform.tfvars` and then `*.auto.tfvars` in alphabetical order.
