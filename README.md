# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning ðŸ¦„

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g. `1.0.1`), increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

More information [here](https://semver.org/).

## Installing Terraform CLI

Updating the gitpod.yml installation script to install the latest version of Terraform CLI.
Instructions [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

### New installation script (Bash file)

- check your [Linux distrubution](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-check-linux-version/): `cat /etc/os-release`
- add [shebang](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-shebang/) to the script file: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- more on [Linux permissions](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-file-permissions-explained):
  `chmod u+x <script_name>`
- use `before` instead of `init` hook, check [GitPod tasks](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks), in short, `init` will not re-run if we restart an existing workspace, `before` will.

The installation file is located here: [`./bin/install_teffaform_cli`](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

## Env

List and filter (`grep`) env variables:
`env | grep GITPOD `
`env | grep terraform-beginner-bootcamp`

### Set and retrieve a variable inside the bash file

We can save the var inside our bash file in order to persist it through all of our future bash sessions.

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT='/workspace/terraform-beginner-bootcamp-2023'
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
```

### Persist an env variable inside gitpod

```bash
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will also have access.
You can also set it inside `.gitpod.yml` file (but only good for non-sensitive en vars).

## Installing AWS CLI

Installed via a bash script. The file is located here: [`./bin/install_aws_cli`](./bin/install_aws_cli)
AWS CLI installation instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

Verify that AWS CLI is installed by running `aws` which will open up a prompt, then run a test command like:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This will error until all the necessary env variables are set.

Only use `aws configure` wizard on your local machine. In a cloud environment use [env vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) instead.

Once you've set the necessary variables (using `gp env`) test the above function again. If succesful, it should return a `json` payload.

> Avoid pushing your AWS credentials to GitHub!

## Terraform

### Terraform Registry

[Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)

A Terraform provider is an interface used for API interactions (with AWS, Azure, GCP etc).
A Terraform module is a package or a template that makes it easier to reuse code.

We'll be using the [random provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest) to generate our resources (random bucket name).

### Terraform CLI

Type `terraform` to see all the available commands.

`terraform init` - initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files (`.tf` files and `.terraform.lock.hcl` file)

> Make sure to add the `.terraform` directory to `.gitignore` file (those binaries are not meant to be pushed to GitHub!)

Then type: `terraform plan` to see what changes will be made to the infrastructure (aka changeset).
Lastly run `terraform apply` to apply the changes.
If you want to auto approve the changes, run `terraform apply -auto-approve` instead.
To only output the value of our `random_bucket_name`, run `terraform output random_bucket_name`.

### Terraform State

`terraform_tfstate` file is used to store the state of our infrastructure. It's a JSON file that contains the metadata of our resources. (should be added to `.gitignore` file)

`terraform.tfstate.backup` is a backup of the previous state.

## Installing additional Terraform providers

Add the aws provider to the `required_providers` block in `main.tf` file.

Anytime you add a new provider, you need to run `terraform init` again.

Note that under the hood, Terraform is using the env variables (that we exported earlier) to authenticate with AWS.

To destroy terraform resources, run `terraform destroy`. To auto approve, run `terraform destroy -auto-approve`.
